user_description: Having 15+ years of experience in technical industry, I have very good experience of prototyping, designing, development and testing of mobile applications. I have a very good experience of Software development processes.  Software projects constantly change from their primary state or initial idea. So I work in sprints. Over the past years, I have successfully developed and deployed many mobile solutions for clients across the globe. I have been using a lot of good programming practices and patterns, that help me write better code. Most of the applications I have worked on, I have developed from scratch, so I know how to design application architecture and write clean and well-maintained code. Your satisfaction and delivering a quality product are my top priorities.
